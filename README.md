## What It Does

Stopwatch Overlay places a customizable timer on top of all your windows — including fullscreen apps and camera feeds. Control it with global hotkeys so you never have to switch away from what you're recording.

### Features

- ⏱️ **Four modes** — Stopwatch, real-time clock, countdown timer (fixed duration or count down to a clock time), and frame-accurate timecode
- 🖥️ **Multi-monitor** — Show the overlay on one screen or all screens at once
- 📌 **Always on top** — Stays visible over fullscreen apps, games, and camera feeds
- 🎨 **Fully customizable** — Text color, border, font, size, background opacity
- ⌨️ **Global hotkeys** — F9–F12 work from any application
- 🏁 **Lap times** — Record split times while the timer runs
-  **REC indicator** — Optional blinking recording dot
- 🖱️ **Click-through mode** — Overlay doesn't interfere with mouse clicks
- 👻 **Hidden from Alt+Tab** — Keeps your taskbar clean

## Tips

- Text outlines keep the timer readable on any background
- You can hide the overlay while keeping the timer running
- Use **click-through mode** so the overlay doesn't interfere with your work
